# Credit Card Intelligence Engine

A terminal-first, data-driven decision engine for Indian credit cards,
built to help users:

- Decide which credit card to apply for
- Decide which credit card to use for a transaction
- Optimize monthly spending across cards
- Redeem reward points for maximum real-world value

---

## Scope (Locked)
- Credit cards: Indian-issued only
- Users: Global (anyone holding Indian cards)
- Platform: Backend-first (CLI → Web → Mobile)
- Workflow: macOS Terminal + GitHub
- Rules: Data-driven (no hardcoding)

---

## Core Modules (Planned)
1. Card application recommendation
2. Card usage recommendation (per transaction)
3. Spend structuring & optimization
4. Reward points redemption intelligence

---

## Design Principles
- Deterministic logic > AI hype
- Transparency over black-box decisions
- Fewer cards, higher accuracy
- Easy extensibility (add more cards later)

---

## Tech Direction
- Language: Python
- Architecture: Data + Engine separation
- Interface: CLI first
- Version control: GitHub (single source of truth)

---

## Status
🚧 In active development (foundation phase)
